/**
 * Domain model for an anime entry.
 *
 * Status-tracking columns (ADR-024) support the notification/auto-download
 * features and let us debug stale data:
 * - [releaseDate] — when the anime was first released.
 * - [lastRefresh] — last time the library entry was refreshed from the source.
 * - [lastMetadataFetch] — last time metadata was fetched (AniList/extension).
 * - [nextEpisodeCheck] — when to next check for a new episode (ADR-014).
 *
 * Library columns (Phase A — library page):
 * - [anilistId] — the AniList media ID, used to link WatchProgressStore entries.
 * - [coverColor] — hex color extracted from the cover for dynamic theming.
 * - [score] — AniList average score (0-100).
 * - [totalEpisodes] — AniList total episodes count.
 * - [lastWatched] — epoch ms of last watch activity (for "Last watched" sort).
 *
 * Two-tier identity (ADR-050 — Phase 1, dormant during transition):
 * - [localId] — Tier 1 per-source identity. Nullable during backfill.
 * - [contentId] — Tier 2 per-content grouping. Nullable during backfill.
 * - [provenance] — Full source provenance (system, repo, extension, …). Nullable.
 *
 * Cross-cutting stores migrate to key off [contentId] in Phases 3–6.
