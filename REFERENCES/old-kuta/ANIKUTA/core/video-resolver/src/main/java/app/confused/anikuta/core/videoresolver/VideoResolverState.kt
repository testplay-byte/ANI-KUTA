package app.confused.anikuta.core.videoresolver

/**
 * The video resolver state machine — drives the `VideoResolverSheet` UI (which
 * remains in `:feature:video-resolver`).
 *
 * Per `DESIGN_LANGUAGE/04-screens/video-resolver.md` §4:
 * - [Hidden] — no sheet shown.
 * - [Resolving] — spinner + "Resolving video sources..." while the source is queried.
 * - [Show] — the full picker with the 3-tier server/audio/quality hierarchy.
 * - [NoSources] — the source returned no playable videos.
 * - [Error] — the resolution failed (network error, timeout, etc.).
 *
 * # Phase 8 — module boundary fix (Doc 04 violations 3+4)
 *
 * This file was moved from `:feature:video-resolver` to `:core:video-resolver`.
 * The state + the resolver types ([ResolverServer], [ResolverAudioVersion],
 * [ResolverVideo], [SubtitleTrack]) are pure Kotlin data — no Compose deps —
 * so they belong in core. The sheet UI that consumes them stays in
 * `:feature:video-resolver`.
