/**
 * Tracks download progress dynamically, handling unknown + changing total sizes.
 *
 * **The problem this solves:**
 * - Many video CDNs don't send `Content-Length` (chunked transfer encoding) →
 *   `total = -1` → the old code showed a stuck progress bar.
 * - Some servers send an initial `Content-Length` that changes mid-download
 *   (redirects, dynamic generation) → the progress bar would jump backward.
 * - The progress bar should NEVER show 100% until the download is verified
 *   complete (the owner's request: "it will never go directly to 100% unless
 *   it is 100% verified that it is completed").
 *
 * **The solution (per the owner's spec):**
 * - If `total` is known + stable: `progress = (downloaded / total) * 90` —
 *   capped at 90% so the bar never shows 100% until completion.
 * - If `total` is unknown (-1): estimate it from the download speed + a
 *   heuristic (grow the estimate as bytes arrive, so the bar advances slowly
 *   toward 90%). If the real total becomes known, snap to the correct ratio.
 * - If `total` changes mid-download: use the LARGER of the old + new total
 *   (never let the bar jump backward). If the downloaded bytes exceed the
 *   new total, re-estimate.
 * - On completion: the queue sets progress to 100 (the tracker's job ends at 90).
 *
 * **Thread-safety:** all methods are synchronous + stateless (pure math on the
 * inputs). The caller (DownloadQueue) handles thread-safety via its mutex.
